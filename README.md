## Deployment

### Forking the GitHub Repository
1. Go to [the project repository](https://github.com/ErikHgm/FireHouse-Restaurant-Project)
2. In the right most top menu, click the "Fork" button.
3. There will now be a copy of the repository in your own GitHub account.


### Running the project locally
1. Go to [the project repository](https://github.com/ErikHgm/FireHouse-Restaurant-Project)
2. Click on the "Code" button.
3. Choose one of the three options (HTTPS, SSH or GitHub CLI) and then click copy.
4. Open the terminal in you IDE program.
5. Type `git clone` and paste the URL that was copied in step 3.
6. Press Enter and the local clone will be created.

### Alternatively by using Gitpod:
1. Go to [the project repository](https://github.com/ErikHgm/FireHouse-Restaurant-Project)
2. Click the green button that says "Gitpod" and the project will now open up in Gitpod.

### Deploying with Heroku

I followed the below steps using the Code Institute tutorial:

The following command in the Gitpod CLI will create the relevant files needed for Heroku to install your project dependencies `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`. Please note this file should be added to a .gitignore file to prevent the file from being committed.

1. Go to [Heroku.com](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) and log in; if you do not already have an account then you will need to create one.
2. Click the `New` dropdown and select `Create New App`.
3. Enter a name for your new project, all Heroku apps need to have a unique name, you will be prompted if you need to change it.
4. Select the region you are working in.

#### Heroku Settings
You will need to set your Environment Variables - this is a key step to ensuring your application is deployed properly.
1. In the Settings tab, click on `Reveal Config Vars` and set the following variables:
    - Add key: `PORT` & value `8000`
    - Add key: DATABASE_URL, this should have been created automatically by Heroku.
    - Add key: CLOUDINARY_URL and the value as your cloudinary API Environment variable e.g.
    - Add key: SECRET_KEY and the value as a complex string which will be used to provide cryptographic signing.

2. Buildpacks are also required for proper deployment, simply click `Add buildpack` and search for the ones that you require.
    - For this project, I needed to add `Python`.

####  Heroku Deployment
In the Deploy tab:
1. Connect your Heroku account to your Github Repository following these steps:
    - Click on the `Deploy` tab and choose `Github-Connect to Github`.
    - Enter the GitHub repository name and click on `Search`.
    - Choose the correct repository for your application and click on `Connect`.
2. You can then choose to deploy the project manually or automatically, automatic deployment will generate a new application every time you push a change to Github, whereas manual deployment requires you to push the `Deploy Branch` button whenever you want a change made.
3. Once you have chosen your deployment method and have clicked `Deploy Branch` your application will be built and you should now see the `View` button, click this to open your application.
